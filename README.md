# Todo List Application

## Overview
This project is a simple Todo List application built using **React.js** and styled with **Tailwind CSS**. The application allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks. Data is stored in the browser's **local storage**, ensuring that tasks persist even after the page is reloaded. The project was created using **Vite** for fast development and optimized build processes.

## Features
- Add new tasks
- Edit existing tasks
- Delete tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- Store tasks in local storage to persist data across page reloads

## Technologies Used
- **React.js** for building the user interface
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling the app
- **Vite** for fast development setup and build tool
- **Local Storage** for persistent data storage

## Project Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/todo-list-app.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd todo-list-app
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (default Vite port).

## How to Use
1. Open the app in your browser.
2. Add a new task by typing in the input field and clicking the "Add" button.
3. Mark tasks as completed by clicking the checkbox next to each task.
4. Edit a task by clicking on the task name and modifying it.
5. Delete a task by clicking the delete icon next to the task.

## Local Storage Integration
All tasks are stored in the browser’s local storage, so they persist even if the page is refreshed. This ensures that tasks remain available across sessions.
